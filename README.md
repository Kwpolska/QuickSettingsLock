Quick Settings Lock for Android
===============================

This small Android app adds a *Lock Screen* tile to your Quick Settings pane.

Usage
-----

This app requires Android 9 (Pie) or newer.  The Accessibility API used by this
app was only added in that version.

1. Install the app. An APK might be available in the
   [Releases](https://github.com/Kwpolska/QuickSettingsLock/releases) section.
2. Go to Settings → Accessibility and enable the QuickSettingsLock service.
   This service can only access events from itself, no other information about
   your device will be processed by the app.
3. Pull down the Quick Settings pane, click the pencil icon, and drag the Lock
   Screen tile to the upper part of the screen. Place it anywhere you like.
